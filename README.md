With Python, i am trying to make a good and secure cryptographer.

If you want to encrypt your texts, currently on this level:

![encrypted](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76222904/133002072-3627e0a4-ac7d-40a9-adba-034ed218bf50.png)

...And decrypt something like this:

![decrypted](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76222904/133002077-afc65955-7766-485c-9582-06ad05179e80.png)

...Have Python in your pc, choose one version and run the "Encrypter.py" or "Decrypter.py"

Now, look at the length of "Vmrtnz" and get your own conclusions about what this meant in the first version.
